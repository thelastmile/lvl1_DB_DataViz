  <h1>Introduction to Databases and Data Visualization</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>Welcome to the next learning module of the class. This segment will introduce two closely related topics that will become important building blocks in the development of your coding skills, <b>databases</b> and <b>data visualization</b>. </p>

  <h2>Databases</h2>
  <p>What is data? Simply put, data is a set of individual pieces of information. Here is a link to a short article on <a href="additionalReading/DataWiki.pdf" target="blank">data</a> from Wikipedia. So if <i>data</i> is a collection of individual bits, a <i>dataset</i> is a grouping of data pertaining to a particular subject.</p>
  <p>As you might imagine, datasets can get pretty large. Modern statistical and scientific analysis commonly works with datasets numbering well into the billions of elements. Obviously we need a way to organize, sort, filter and manipulate these datasets if we're going to get any work done. This is where a database comes in.</p>
  <p>A <a href="additionalReading/Database.pdf">database</a> is a system, typically software-based, that provides exactly this type of functionality. There are a number of different types of databases including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li> <a href="additionalReading/Relationaldatabase.pdf" target="blank">Relational Databases</a> </li>
    <li> <a href="additionalReading/Objectdatabase.pdf" target="blank">Object-oriented</a> or <a href="additionalReading/NoSQL.pdf" target="blank">NoSQL</a> Databases</li>
    <li> <a href="additionalReading/Graphdatabase.pdf" target="blank">Graph</a> Databases</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Each of these databases are optimized for handling data in different ways, but at their core they all provide the common function of data management. An most obvious difference between databases is the language and syntax used to interact with them, and one of the most widely used formats is <b>Structured Query Language</b>, or <a href="additionalReading/SQL.pdf" target="blank">SQL</a>. </p>
  <h3><a href="www.sqlite.org/index.html" target="blank">SQLite</a></h3>
  <p>For this module, we will be using a very small version of a SQL databast called SQLite. You will follow a tutorial that will introduce some very basic SQL commands and give you some hands-on experience writing SQL code. Follow the links below to the SQL exercises, and additional reading material.</p>

    <li><a href="www.sqlite.org/docs.html" target="blank">SQLite Documentation</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Visualization</h2>
  <p>The field of data visualization offers a great opportunity to combine technical and design skills to create meaningful visual representations of data. It's often the case that the complexity and volume of a dataset make it simply overwhelming to assimilate through columns of numbers and text. Data Visualization is the art and science of finding the best way to translate complex datasets into meaningful graphics. This enables better communication and understanding of complex data, and if it's done well can lead to interpretations that might not have been possible otherwise.</p>
  <p>Data Visualization is not a product of computer science. Graphic representation of data has been around for hundreds of years. One of the best data visualizations ever was created by the 19th century French engineer <a href="additionalReading/MinardWiki.pdf" target="blank">Charles Joseph Minard</a>, and depicted Napoleon's disastrous <a href="additionalReading/AnalyzingMinardsVisualizationOfNapoleons1812March.pdf" target="blank">1812 military campaign</a>.</p>
  <p>As you can see from the linked article, Minard was able to use visual terms to clearly and accurately relate information about numerous data points related to Napoleon's march.</p>
  <h3>D3.js</h3>

  <p>For this module, you will be working with a popular library called <b>D3.js</b>. Many data visualizations created for the web are based on D3, and it provides the basis for numerous other libraries that extend it's functionality. D3 is a very powerful library, and it leverages native HTML5 DOM interaction and SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) capabilities.</p>

  <p>Follow the links below to the exercise material:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="DashingD3/toc.html" target="blank">Dashing D3 Introduction to Data Visualization</a>:<b>  Primary exercises</b> - Start here for an excellent introduciton to D3 from one of the top online resources on the subject. Everyone should cover chapters 1 - 9. If you feel comfortable with the material, do all 20!</li>
    <li><a href="InteractiveDataVizForWeb/Interactive_Data_Visualization_for_the_Web.pdf" target="blank">Interactive Data Visualization for the Web</a>: <b>  Secondary exercises</b> - a great PDF book with a well-written introduction to D3. Associated exercise files are located in the folder '/InteractiveDataVizForWeb/', and are sorted by chapter.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Goals</h3>

  <p>Your goal for this learning module should be the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Get a first look at SQL, and write some basic code.</li>
    <li>Gain a basic understanding of what a SQL database does, and what databases do in general.</li>
    <li>Read the material introducint the concepts of data visualization, and gain a high-level understanding of this topic.</li>
    <li>Work through as much of the D3 material as possible, and write as much code as you can using the exercises provided. Be sure to work with your Chrome dev tools open, and examine your code carefully to gain an understanding of what is happening.</li>
    <li>If you complete the primary exercises and feel confident, create some data visualizations of your own using the additional data sets listed below.</li>
  </ul>
